# 📰 Fake News Detection using Hybrid AI Model

This project aims to build a **Fake News Detection System** using a hybrid AI approach that analyzes both textual and visual content. The model integrates traditional machine learning for text classification and deep learning for image classification to accurately detect whether a news item is fake or real.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Text-based Detection** using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
- 🖼️ **Image-based Detection** using:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with pre-trained VGG16
- 📊 **Hybrid Model** combining both modalities for improved accuracy
- 📚 **Model evaluation** with confusion matrix, accuracy, and visual plots
- 🧪 **Easy testing** with custom user input (text/image)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 📄 Text Classification

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF vectorization
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes
- **Output**: Fake or Real news label

### 🖼️ Image Classification

- **Input**: News-related images
- **Model**: VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet) with custom classification head
- **Output**: Fake or Real image classification

### 🔗 Combined Decision

- Weighted or parallel decision-making based on text and image results

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

	2.	Run the main notebook:
Open majaorproject.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
	3.	Test your own input:
	•	Input a news headline or body text.
	•	Upload an associated image (optional).
	•	Get a prediction: Fake or Real.

⸻

📊 Results
	•	Text Accuracy:
	•	Logistic Regression: ~96%
	•	Random Forest: ~93%
	•	Naive Bayes: ~95%
	•	Image Accuracy (VGG16): ~92%
